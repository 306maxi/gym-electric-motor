Dashboard
#############

In the dashboard, the environment states are visualized during an episode. The plot is updated simultaneously to the
run time of the control. The input voltage is drawn in  magenta and the other state variables are plotted in blue.
References are shown in green.
Furthermore, nominal limits (dotted-yellow) and technical limits (dashed-red) are depicted.
The plots can be used to analyze the behaviour of the controller.
